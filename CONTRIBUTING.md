# Contributing to AutoPR

Got an idea on how to improve AutoPR?
Contributions welcome, and greatly appreciated! 🙏

## Opening Issues to Contribute

You can also contribute by opening issues for new features, bug reports, or improvements. This repository reacts to new issues by running itself and creating a PR that attempts to implement the request or idea described in the issue. Please note that for non-contributors, a manual trigger is required to prevent expensive runs. Feel free to open issues to share your ideas and contribute to the project.

Make sure to provide a clear and detailed description of the issue, and if possible, add examples or references to help others understand the context. Your contribution through opening issues is valuable and appreciated.

By contributing through issues, you're not only improving AutoPR but also helping create a better experience for other users and developers.

Now, let's dive into the more technical aspects of contributing to AutoPR.

## Overview

AutoPR works in two main steps:
- Gather context and plan a pull request
- Generate code for each commit

It's easy to add a new implementation for either of the two steps. 
As long as the file is in the correct directory, it will be automatically picked up by the action – simply refer to it by its id.

## Using a custom component

To use a custom pull request or code generator agent, simply refer to it by its `id` in the action's `with` section.
Make sure you're pointing to the correct branch (in this example `main`).

Example:

`>>> .github/workflows/autopr.yml`
```yaml

...
    - name: AutoPR
      uses: irgolic/AutoPR@main
      with:
        codegen_agent_id: my-codegen
        pull_request_agent_id: my-pr-agent
...
```

### Adding a new pull request agent

To add a new PR planner, create a new file in `autopr/agents/pull_request_agent/` and subclass `PullRequestAgentBase`. 
The new class should declare an `id` and implement the `_plan_pull_request` method.

Example:

`>>> autopr/agents/planner_agent/my_planner_agent.py`
```python

from typing import Union
from git.repo import Repo
from autopr.agents.pull_request_agent import PullRequestAgentBase
from autopr.models.artifacts import Issue
from autopr.models.rail_objects import PullRequestDescription
from autopr.models.events import IssueOpenedEvent, IssueCommentEvent


class MyPullRequestAgent(PullRequestAgentBase):
    id = "my-pr-agent"

    def _plan_pull_request(
        self, 
        issue: Issue, 
        repo: Repo,
        event: Union[IssueOpenedEvent, IssueCommentEvent],
    ) -> Union[str, PullRequestDescription]:
        return """
Title: My PR title
Body: My PR body
Commits:
  1. Title: My commit title
     Files:
       - path/to/file.py
       - path/to/another/file.py
  2. Title: My second commit title
     Files:
       - path/to/file.py
       - path/to/another/file.py
"""
```

The plan can be returned as a `PullRequestDescription` object, or as a string as shown in the dummy example above.
If it is returned as a string, it will automatically be parsed into a `PullRequestDescription` object with guardrails.


### Adding a new code generator

To add a new code generator, create a new file in `autopr/agents/codegen_agent/` and subclass `CodegenAgentBase`. 
Similarly to the pull request agent, the new class should declare an `id` and implement the `_generate_code` method.

Example:

`>>> autopr/agents/codegen_agent/my_codegen_agent.py`
```python

from autopr.agents.codegen_agent import CodegenAgentBase
from autopr.models.artifacts import Issue, DiffStr
from git.repo import Repo
from autopr.models.rail_objects import CommitPlan, PullRequestDescription

class MyCodegenAgent(CodegenAgentBase):
    id = "my-codegen"

    def _generate_patch(
        self,
        repo: Repo,
        issue: Issue,
        pr_desc: PullRequestDescription,
        current_commit: CommitPlan,
    ) -> DiffStr:    
        return """
--- /dev/null
+++ dummy.py
@@ -0,0 +1,2 @@
+def dummy():
+    pass
"""
```

The output of the code generator is a string, which must be a valid patch as applicable by GNU `patch`.
We're currently working on a serializable patch format similar to the pull request agent agent's `PullRequestDescription` object.

## How guardrails is used in AutoPR

RailService is a service that runs rails defined in `autopr/models/rails.py`. 
It's accessible by default in PR agents and code generators at `self.rail_service`.
The rails' output models are defined in `autopr/models/rail_objects.py`.

Each rail run consists of two calls:
- one with a raw chat message, talking with the LLM in natural language,
- one with guardrails, asking the LLM to serialize the previous response to a typed JSON object.

Feel free to define your own rails and develop alternate strategies for describing pull requests and generating code. 
Or ignore them altogether and try an approach with a different library.
